STAT 5850 Data Mining Final Project

This repository contains the code for a data mining project on academic performance between two 
Portuguese schools in a math and Portuguese language course.

The final report can be read on my portfolio website hosted by GitHub. 

The scripts are separated by analyses and should ultimately be run together, starting with the 
"Clean&Visualize" script. The "Train&Test" script is also vital to many analyses and so should be ran second. 

I've enjoyed working on this project, using different data mining techniques. It is not perfect and I welcome all constructive criticism or opinion on my work as I am still learning!
